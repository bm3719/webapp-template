#+STARTUP: showall

* webapp-template

A template for a web application written entirely in Clojure and
ClojureScript.

** Usage

To run the server from the REPL:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; TODO: Example forthcoming.
#+END_SRC

** Details

The goal of this template is to bring together the best and most idiomatic
practices (as of 2018) for creating a Clojure and Clojurescript web
application.  Necessarily, it makes a few judgment calls where community
consensus doesn't exist.

This is still WIP, but some things I know I do want here:

- Single-page app.
- A sample front-end with just a few features past Hello World.  This will be
  based on a somewhat modified set of the practices described in parts of the
  book [[https://pragprog.com/book/dswdcloj2/web-development-with-clojure-second-edition][Web Development with Clojure]].
- [[https://github.com/stuartsierra/component][Component]] will wrap all state management and service integration.
- The [[http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded][reloaded workflow]], integrated with Component.
- [[https://github.com/juxt/bidi][bidi]] will handle URI routing.
- [[http://aleph.io/][Aleph]] for the integrated webserver.  Might just have this just for running in
  development, and having the application run in a servlet container by
  default.
- Full stack unit and integration tests.  Possible generative tests too.
- Probably other stuff, like clojure.spec, Hiccup (for HTML templating), some
  documentation generation solution, etc.
